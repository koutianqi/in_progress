## Bio:

My research examines **the ethics and politics in the process of producing and disseminating Machine Learning (ML) research and technology**, with a focus on epistemic and ethical accountability. Combining philosophical analysis with social scientific methods from Science and Technology Studies, I identify and address **communicative dysfunctions in these processes** - analyzing what goes wrong, why it matters, and how to fix it. My ultimate aim is to strengthen accountability mechanisms in the communicative dimension through practical tools, institutional reforms, technology policy, and regulatory frameworks. My work has appeared in venues spanning Philosophy of Science, Computer Science, and Humanâ€“Computer Interaction. Read more about my previous and ongoing projects [Here](https://koutianqi.github.io/pages/research/).

Before Penn State, I worked in the industry for two years as a Machine Learning Engineer. I received a BS in Economics from Harbin Institute of Technology and Monash University with high honors, and a MS in Computer Science from Fordham University with Dean's Fellowship where I developed a semi-supervised variant of Support Vector Machines.
