              **Welcome!** I am a PhD Candidate at Penn State Information School advised by <a href="https://www.dcalacci.net">Dr. Dana Calacci</a>, my research examines the **ethics** and **politics** in the communicative dimension of Machine Learning (ML) research and technology, with a focus on epistemic and ethical accountability. Trained in Science and Technology Studies, I use philosophical analysis and social scientific methods to study **communicative norms** around ML - what goes wrong, why it matters, and how to fix it. My ultimate aim is to strengthen accountability in the communicative dimension through governance solutions.

            I am a PhD Candidate at Penn State Information School advised by <a href="https://www.dcalacci.net">Dr. Dana Calacci</a>, an affiliate of <a href="https://csrai.psu.edu">Center for Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence (CSRAI)</a> at Penn State, and a Liberal Tech Scholar at critical tech pubilcation <a href="https://logicmag.io">LOGIC(S)</a>. I am also a visiting scholar at <a href="https://www.crit-technocultures.com">Critical Technocultures Lab</a> at the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech.

            I received a BS in Economics from Harbin Institute of Technology and Monash University with high honors, and a MS in Computer Science from Fordham University with Dean's Fellowship where I developed a semi-supervised variant of Support Vector Machines. Afterwards, I worked in industry for two years as a Machine Learning Engineer. These experiences shifted my earlier views of science, revealing it to be subjective, messy, and political, and motivating me to examine the epistemic and ethical implications of such nature.
