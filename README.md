# Tianqi Kou â€” Static Site

first time using html to build stuff, exciting

## Local development

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or serve the directory via a local HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080`.

## Structure

```
assets/
  css/styles.css
  js/main.js
  img/
index.html
```

## Notes

- Design inspo from various academics' websites that I liked.
- The design uses a lightweight, responsive layout with no build step.
